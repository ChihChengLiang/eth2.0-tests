> Eth2.0 test format working group

[TOC]

## Summary
Working group focused on ironing out details related to a common test framework.

## Expected Outcome

* Propose any changes or clarifications to [`test-format.md`](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/39)
* Propose an organizational structure for tests
* Propose any number of "test suite" test case structures
    * SSZ
    * Chain tests
    * shuffle
    * etc
* Propose changes in the eth2.0 cross-client testing to

## Current Status

There is a currently a proposed general format under review [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/39). The idea is to have a general outer format for each test file along with an associated `test_suite` field that defines the format for the included `test_cases`.

We are currently opting for YAML due to wide language support and support for inline comments.

There is a ton of knowledge (of what works and does not) from eth1.0 testing that we should leverage in designing this new testing framework.
